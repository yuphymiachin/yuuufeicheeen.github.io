# Alice in Wonderland
The story and characters are inspired by *Alice in Wonderland*, which is an 1865 novel written by English mathematician Charles Lutwidge Dodgson under the pseudonym Lewis Carroll.
> The setting is Wonderland, a strange and seemingly crazy world that is entered by dropping into a rabbit hole. Animals act as normal people. Physical size as well as time are relative. The story also partly takes place in our 'real' world, where Alice starts in by sitting next to her sister, and wakes up in.
